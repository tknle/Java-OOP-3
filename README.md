# Java Object Oriented Programming 3
Java Programming by Duke University on Coursera

## Description
Learning Java new data structures. Use these data structures to build more complex programs that use 
Javaâ€™s object-oriented features. <br /> Build an encryption program and a program to break your encryption 
algorithm.

## Outcome
1. Read and write data from/to files;
2. Solve problems involving data files;
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.
